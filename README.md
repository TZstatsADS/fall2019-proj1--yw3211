### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: What Make Metal Special? - A Comparasion between Metal and Rock
+ This project is conducted by [Yakun Wang]

+ Project summary: Metal music is a subgenre of rock music. However, in our dataset, these two types of music are well separated. Therefore, I want to explore how Metal is different from regular Rock music and what make Metal special.
